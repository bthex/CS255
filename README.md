Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
  The client for the DriverPass project was Liam.
  Liam wanted to design software that would be able to increase is customers ability to pass the DMV's driver exam
  by giving the users of DriverPass access to practice tests and study materials. DriverPass will be connected to the
  DMV server to allow all provided information to be up to date. Along with study materials and tests DriverPass will
  allow its users to book in person driver training where they can get information they need to work on.
  
What did you do particularly well?
  For this project I feel like I collected to overall needs of the client well. Some of the needs were spread throughout
  but overall I think I found the needs and implemented them into the design in a beneficail and possible way.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  I think that even though I found the needs and put them in the design document I could have explained them in a more clear way.
  I can understand the document completely but it may not be as apparent to someone else reading through the document.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider
the user’s needs when designing?
  When designing DriverPass I tried to implement all the clients needs first. After figuring out what the system was going
  to function I started figuring out how to interact with the system, as an admin of the system and a user of the system.
  To complete this I created a use case diagram and listed all the use cases for the system I could think of. Addressing the
  needs of the user is important becuase it is directly related to the quality of the system being created. If the system has
  everything the client wants but it extremely difficult for users to interact with the DriverPass will fail.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design
a system?
  This class was difficult for me. I think that having the overall picture for the system is relatively easy but I can struggle to 
  find all the smaller needs spread throughout a interview or requirements document. To help catch all the needs I try to write them down
  or copy them to another document when I find them. After getting all of the needs to written down I seperate them into functional and non
  functional needs. After having everything split I can start creating use case diagrams to better understand how the system is interacted with
  and functions.
